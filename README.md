# Belly_Button_Dashboard

The idea behind this HTML is to be able to call on an ID no and for the webpage to load with that subjects demographics and results. Among the reasults will be a bar graph that shows the top ten bacertial species found in that subject's belly button, the number of bacteria cultures found per sample and what those cultures were, and lastly a gauge chart that shows how often the subject washes. You can see the webpage I designed by clicking on the link below.
